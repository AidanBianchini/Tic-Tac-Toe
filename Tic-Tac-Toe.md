# Tic-Tac-Toe
It is a game of tic-tac-toe, implemented in Python. It is a simple game played between two players, that most people should know. However, if 
you do not know tic-tac-toe you can read about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe. This game is also sometimes referred
to as noughts and crosses

I've utilized recursion in this project, trying to make long for loops shorter and more succinct. In the future, I would like to add an additional
computer difficulty level, in addition to the two I already have. This is because one of them is a very easy difficulty level, where the computer simply uses a random number generator to pick a spot on the board. In contrast, the other difficulty level is impossible because the computer can see and predict moves the player will make, prior to them making it.
